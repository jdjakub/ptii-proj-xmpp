I started the test server and opened the utop toplevel.

I used the following utility to open a connection, returning its output channel:

let conn () = snd (Unix.(open_connection (ADDR_INET(inet_addr_loopback, 5222))))

I opened three connections:

let c1 = conn()
let c2 = conn()
let c3 = conn()

The server printed

Some client connected
Some client connected
Some client connected

I then gave the clients names in the order 1,2,3:

output_string c1 "Client #1\n";
output_string c2 "Client #2\n";
output_string c3 "Client #3\n";

Nothing was printed on the server. I then fed each of the clients new lines in the order 3,2,1, thus causing the server to remove their names:

output_string c3 "ggggg\n";
output_string c2 "ggggg\n";;
output_string c1 "ggggg\n";;

Still nothing was printed on the server. Finally, I closed the sockets in the same order:

Unix.(close_out c3; close_out c2; close_out c1);;

Now, all the output appeared on the server, but in an unexpected order:

Client connected: Client #2; 1 connected clients:
Client #2
Client disconnected: Client #2
Client connected: Client #3; 1 connected clients:
Client #3
Client disconnected: Client #3
Client connected: Client #1; 1 connected clients:
Client #1
Client disconnected: Client #1

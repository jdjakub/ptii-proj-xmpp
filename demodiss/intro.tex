\chapter{Introduction}
The eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is designed for passing XML messages between clients and servers. Amongst its services are ordinary instant-messaging functionality, storage of contacts, discovery of online status of users, and push-based notifications. Google and Apple employ it for the latter use, and it is central to the well-known WhatsApp messaging application.

There are implementations for many protocols in the OCaml ecosystem, mainly targeting MirageOS. XMPP is lacking, however, and in this project I set out to build a working implementation of the XMPP protocol for OCaml.
